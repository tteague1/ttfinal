       This app will allow you to keep track of the children coming and going from your event. 
       By using this app, you will have a picture of the child with the time in and time out of the event.
       You can also enter the name of the person that dropped the child off or brought them to the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main goal here is to assist you in keeping the children of your event safe. By using the tabs at the 
       bottom, you can start adding event info, child information and then see a final screen with the
       information entered.
